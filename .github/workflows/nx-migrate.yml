# This workflow is used to augment the capabilities of the renovate GitHub app by running a full
# `nx migrate` when renovate opens a PR to change the version of nx in package.json.
#
# You will therefore also notice that in the renovate configuration, we ignore any packages which
# Nx will manage for us as part of `nx migrate` such as the remaining @nx/* packages.
